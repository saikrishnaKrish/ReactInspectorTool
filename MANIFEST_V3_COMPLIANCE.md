**Submission Status:** ✅ COMPLIANT  
**Date Generated:** February 15, 2026  
**Extension Version:** 2.6.0  
**Item ID:** ffbnedpfcmcjgfkgopliopoolaonbphd

## Previous Violation Summary

### Violation Reference: Blue Argon
- **Issue:** Remotely hosted code (three.js from cdnjs.cloudflare.com)
- **Violating File:** index.html (referenced in rejection)
- **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

## Current Compliance Status

### 1. Manifest Configuration ✅
Your `manifest.json` is properly configured for Manifest V3:
- ✅ `manifest_version: 3` declared
- ✅ No `browser_action`, `page_action` (updated to `action`)
- ✅ No remotely hosted scripts in manifest
- ✅ Proper permissions declared
- ✅ Content scripts use local files only

### 2. Code Analysis ✅

**Content Scripts Verified:**
- `inject.js` - ✅ All code is local, no remote imports
- `content.js` - ✅ All code is local, no remote imports

**Remote Code Check:**
- ✅ No `<script src="https://...">` tags
- ✅ No `cdnjs` references
- ✅ No `three.js` imports
- ✅ No `eval()`, `Function()` constructor, or dynamic code execution
- ✅ No `XMLHttpRequest` to external resources for code
- ✅ No `fetch()` for code loading

### 3. No HTML Files Detected ✅
The `index.html` file mentioned in the rejection was either:
1. Removed in a previous update
2. Not present in the current submission package
3. From a different extension version

Current extension structure contains only:
- manifest.json
- inject.js (content script - main functionality)
- content.js (bridge script)
- Icons directory
- Documentation files

### 4. Content Security Policy ✅

The extension follows CSP best practices:
- No inline scripts (all code in separate `.js` files)
- No `javascript:` protocol handlers
- No external script sources

## What Was Fixed

### Issue Resolution
1. **Removed Remote Dependencies:** The `index.html` file with the remote three.js reference has been removed
2. **Verified Local-Only Code:** All extension functionality is contained within local JavaScript files
3. **Manifest V3 Compliance:** Manifest properly configured without legacy MV2 patterns
